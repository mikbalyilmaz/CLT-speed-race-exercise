# CLT-speed-race-exercise
Interactive simulation of the Central Limit Theorem showing how fast the standardized sample mean converges to normality across distributions. Visualizes histograms, ECDF–normal differences, and KS distance while comparing tail behavior and skewness effects. Supports animation recording for reproducible convergence “speed race” experiments.
